# Slimy Floor

This is a Fabric, server only mod. It's inspired by a tweet from [Cubfan135](https://twitter.com/cubfan135/status/1369763834223865859).
 
This mod produces slime particles and a tiny squishy sound on players' feet when they walk or run in a slime chunk area.

Slime chunks are chunks that have the capability to spawn slimes below Y=40. Without the help of external tools, they are hard to detect while roaming in caves as slime spawning is low, especially when a lot of dark caves are nearby and the mob cap is filled. So this mod adds a visual clue that slimes can spawn in the current chunks, as if you were stepping on a slime deposit.

As this is a server side mod, all players benefit of the feature to detect slime chunks while staying close to vanilla. There's nothing to install on clients.
